# activity_sprunkruns

Very simple system for "sprunkruns", which is on paper just box deliveries to vending machines. It is basically just like store runs, but in my opinion it can add a little extra RP, by having to go into locations that are a bit harder to reach (i.e. Mission Row break room) or by having to walk into the Pillbox lobby. However this could also be undesirable.

## Config options

All config files in `src/common`

- `areas.ts`
  - Very simple definition for every GTA zone with enabled bool.
- `config.ts`
  - `ACTIVITY_NAME` self-explanatory. All events are string formatted
  - `VEHICLE` used vehicle model, pony has a Sprunk livery.
  - `SPAWN_LOCATION` vector3 for where the cars spawn
  - `SPAWN_HEADING` self explanatory
  - `ZONE_INTERVAL` script checks (default 500ms) if the player is in zone or not. Player can not deliver boxes or even get boxes if he is not in the right zone.
  - `BOXES_PER_ZONE` how many boxes need to be delivered in a zone? Set to 1 because it can actually be quite hard.
  - `ZONE_AMOUNT` how many zones are done in a run, set to 2 by default like garbage runs
  - `COMPLETION_TIMES` for the third `activityInProgress`, has placeholder values
- `types.ts`
  - Just ts types
